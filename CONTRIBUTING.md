# Contributing to Pi-hole Network Analyzer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Pi-hole Network Analyzer! This document provides guidelines for contributing to ensure a smooth development process.

## üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection & Development Workflow

This repository uses **branch protection rules** to maintain code quality and ensure safe collaboration:

- **All changes must go through pull requests** - direct pushes to main branch are blocked
- **CI status checks must pass** before merging (tests, builds, security scans)
- **Pull request reviews are required** before merging
- **Conversation resolution is mandatory** before merging
- **Force pushes and branch deletions are prevented** on main branch

For detailed information, see [Branch Protection Configuration](.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md).

## üöÄ Development Process

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pihole-network-analyzer.git
cd pihole-network-analyzer

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/GrammaTonic/pihole-network-analyzer.git
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Keep your branch up to date with upstream
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 3. Development Standards

#### Code Quality
- **Go Formatting**: Run `make fmt` before committing
- **Linting**: Run `make vet` to check for issues  
- **Testing**: Run `make ci-test` to validate your changes
- **Build Verification**: Run `make feature-branch` for comprehensive validation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Add tests for new functionality in `tests/unit/`
- **Integration Tests**: Update integration tests if needed in `tests/integration/`
- **CI Compatibility**: Ensure tests pass in CI environment

#### Documentation
- **Code Comments**: Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- **README Updates**: Update documentation for new features
- **API Changes**: Document any breaking changes

### 4. Commit Guidelines

#### Commit Message Format
Use conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(colors): add new domain highlighting for development sites"
git commit -m "fix(ssh): handle connection timeout gracefully"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

### 5. Pre-Commit Validation

Before pushing your changes:

```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
make feature-branch

# Or run individual checks
make ci-test          # Same tests as CI
make fmt              # Format code
make vet              # Static analysis
make multi-build      # Test cross-platform builds
```

### 6. Submit Pull Request

#### Creating the PR
1. **Push your feature branch** to your fork
2. **Open a pull request** against the main branch
3. **Fill out the PR template** completely
4. **Link related issues** using keywords (fixes #123)

#### PR Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Clear title and description** explaining the changes
- ‚úÖ **All CI checks passing** (automated via branch protection)
- ‚úÖ **Code review approval** from maintainers
- ‚úÖ **Conversations resolved** before merging
- ‚úÖ **Up-to-date with main branch** (will be enforced)

#### PR Review Process
- **Automated checks** run automatically (tests, builds, security)
- **Maintainer review** provides feedback and approval
- **Address feedback** by pushing new commits to your branch
- **Auto-merge** when all requirements are satisfied
